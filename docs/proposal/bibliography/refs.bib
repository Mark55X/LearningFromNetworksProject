  abstract  = {Arbitrage is generally defined as capitalising on a discrepancy in quoted prices, triggered by the violation of an equilibrium (pricing) condition. It is often the case that arbitrage is portrayed to be a riskless operation, in the sense that all of the decision variables are known when the decision is made, but the process invariably involves risk, such as the risk of non-delivery (Herstatt risk). The arbitrage process restores equilibrium via changes in the supply of and demand for the underlying commodity, asset or currency. These changes in supply and demand cause price changes in such a way as to restore the equilibrium no-arbitrage condition. At this point the arbitrage process comes to an end, as the operation becomes unprofitable.},

  abstract = {&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The ergm package supports the statistical analysis and simulation of network data. It anchors the statnet suite of packages for network analysis in R introduced in a special issue in Journal of Statistical Software in 2008. This article provides an overview of the new functionality in the 2021 release of ergm version 4. These include more flexible handling of nodal covariates, term operators that extend and simplify model specification, new models for networks with valued edges, improved handling of constraints on the sample space of networks, and estimation with missing edge data. We also identify the new packages in the statnet suite that extend ergm’s functionality to other network data types and structural features and the robust set of online resources that support the statnet development process and applications.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;},
