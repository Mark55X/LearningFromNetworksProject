\begin{projsection}{Objectives}
	Various key characteristics of the network will be analyzed within this framework, progressing from simple structures to more complex ones.
	The study begins with an examination of the weighted degree of a node \cite{gonzalez2010an}. Subsequently, the concepts of paths and simple paths will be explored.\\
	The analysis then extends to cycles and their behavior, emphasizing their significance and potential applications in network analysis.
	
	As the study advances, the focus shifts to more intricate concepts, such as distance, which emerges as a particularly challenging notion on this kind of Directed Random Weighted Graphs.
	Some probabilistics results will be discussed and the development and evaluation of approximation algorithms will be developed, particularly in situations where exact computation becomes impractical for large-scale graphs.
	Finally, important network metrics, such as the diameter, will be examined and their implications for the overall structure will be explored.
