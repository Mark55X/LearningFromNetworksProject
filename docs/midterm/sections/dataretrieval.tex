\begin{projsection}{Data Retrieval from Binance}
	As mentioned in the project proposal, the Binance platform offers CSV files that contain information on cryptocurrency trades.
	Through a GitHub repository\footnote{https://github.com/binance/binance-public-data}, Binance provides Python code to download the files, allowing users to choose the granularity of the information.
	
	It was decided to download transactions for a single month of the current year to manage memory usage and reduce variance in the data.
	
	An additional Python script was devised to process the downloaded data and adapt it to the graph model. This will allow for concrete analysis of the observed values.
