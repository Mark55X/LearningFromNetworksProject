\begin{projsection}{Data Retrieval from Binance}
	As mentioned in the project proposal, the Binance platform offers CSV files that contain information on cryptocurrency trades. Through a GitHub repository\footnote{https://github.com/binance/binance-public-data}, Binance provides Python code to download the files by deciding the granularity of the information. It was decided to download the data of a single month of the current year for a matter of memory and a lower variance in the data.
	An additional Python code was created to manage the downloaded data in order to adapt them to the model of the graph studied. The creation of a graph on real data will allow the concrete analysis of the theoretical aspects addressed in the project.
