\begin{projsection}{Algorithm}
	A new algorithm for the shortest path problem will be presented in detail in the final report.
	The algorithm is divided in two phases, a static phase and a dynamic phase.
	The static phase is a modified version of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, adapted to our model on random graphs.
	It consists of computing an estimate for the shortest path length among all pairs of nodes.
	The dynamic phase allows to perform the algorithm over an observed instance of the graph.
	Given the estimates, computed only once, this phase will exploit the observed information to predict the shortest path among a desired pair of nodes through a greedy approach.
