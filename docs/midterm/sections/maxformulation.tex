\begin{projsection}{Max Formulation}
	As previously outlined in the project proposal, several features of the graph rely on the concept of a maximum, such as the graph degree (the maximum degree among its nodes).
	While this concept is straightforward in the context of real numbers, it becomes significantly more complex when dealing with random variables, as the maximum of normal random variables does not follow a normal distribution. Consequently, an exact formula was derived to compute the expectation of this distribution, which inherently requires the evaluation of an improper integral.
	
	The computational time required to obtain the result increases significantly with the number of variables involved in determining the maximum.
	After analyzing the integration function, a more efficient method was developed.
	
	For a very large number of variables, even this approach may become computationally expensive. Therefore, an additional approximation method based on the Gumbel distribution is under study.
	
	Charts were generated to illustrate the trends of the obtained values and their corresponding computational times.
	%Graphs were developed to illustrate the trends of the obtained values and the corresponding computational times.
