\begin{projsection}{Max Formulation}
	As previously outlined in the project proposal, several features of the nodes or the graph rely on the concept of a maximum, such as the graph degree (the maximum degree among its nodes). While this concept is straightforward in the context of real numbers, it becomes significantly more complex when dealing with random variables, as the maximum of normal functions does not follow a normal distribution. Consequently, an exact equation was formulated to compute the expectation of this distribution, which inherently requires the evaluation of an improper integral.
	
	The computational time needed to obtain the result increased significantly with the number of variables involved in finding the maximum. By analyzing the integration function, a faster method was developed to compute the lower and upper bounds of the function.
	
	For a very large number of variables, even this method could become computationally expensive. Therefore, an additional approximation method based on the Gumbel distribution is argument of study.
	
	Graphs were developed to illustrate the trends of the obtained values and the corresponding computational times.
