\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}
The definition of this new type of graph, the Directed Random Weighted Graph, has allowed the analysis and study of new probabilistic techniques for modeling random variables. Furthermore, it has allowed the study of an interesting scenario regarding the world of cryptocurrencies, characterized by highly uncertain dynamics, in which the connections between nodes represent financial relationships subject to temporal fluctuations and randomness.
The development of a new algorithm for calculating the shortest path following a greedy approach has been proposed with better results than those of the Bellman-Ford algorithm, an exact algorithm for calculating shortest paths.
Future studies could be interesting to be able to extend this type of graph also to different probabilistic distributions, in order to analyze different real scenarios, in which the connections between the different nodes fluctuate over time.
