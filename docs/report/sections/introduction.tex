\section{Introduction}

A graph \( G = (V, A) \) is defined as Directed Random Weighted Graph (DRWG) if it satisfies the following properties:

\begin{itemize}[nolistsep]
	\item It is a directed graph.
	\item Each arc $(u,v) \in A$ with $u,v \in V$ has a weight that follow the distribution of a random variables.
\end{itemize}

In this project, we proposed a relaxed-version of this graph in which random variables $X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$
