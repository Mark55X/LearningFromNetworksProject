	The work done was divided equally between all three members of the group. The code review and the final paper were done together.
	% Work breakdown: Motiv. - Parpaiola, Obj. - Frigione, Int. E. - Stefani
	
	The preparation of this report was carried out with contributions divided as follows:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Marco Stefani} contributed by writing the chapter on \textit{Max Formulation}.
		\item \textbf{Luigi Frigione} authored the chapter on the \textit{Shortest Path Algorithm}.
		\item \textbf{Parpaiola Edoardo} prepared the chapter on \textit{Real Data Analysis}.
		\item The chapters \textit{Introduction} and \textit{Conclusion} were collaboratively written by all authors.
	\end{itemize}
	
	For the Python notebook:	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Marco Stefani}: Developed the implementation of the maximum formulation.
		\item \textbf{Luigi Frigione}: Designed and implemented the static component of the shortest path algorithm.
		\item \textbf{Parpaiola Edoardo}: Worked on the implementation of data retrieval processes.
		\item \textbf{All Authors}: Collaboratively conducted experiments and contributed to the analysis of results.
