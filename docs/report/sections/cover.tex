\begin{abstract}
This paper introduces a novel model for weighted directed random graphs, in which the graph structure (i.e., the vertices and arcs) is fixed, while the arc weights are treated as random variables.

Various key features of the network are analyzed within this framework, progressing from simple structures to more complex ones.

The study begins with an examination of the weighted degree of a node\cite{gonzalez2010an}.
Next, the concept of shortest path is explored and a new greedy algorithm is proposed to compute it.
Finally, to analyze the graph structure and the proposed algorithm, some experiments are performed in a real-world scenario using data retrieved from Binance.
