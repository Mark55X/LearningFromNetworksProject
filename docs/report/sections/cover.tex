\begin{abstract}
This paper introduces a novel model for weighted directed random graphs, in which the graph structure (i.e., the vertices and arcs) is fixed, while the arc weights are treated as random variables.

Various key characteristics of the network will be analyzed within this framework, progressing from simple structures to more complex ones.

The study begins with an examination of the weighted degree of a node\cite{gonzalez2010an}.
Subsequently, the concept of shortest path will be explored and a new algorithm will be proposed.
The analysis then extends to cycles and their behavior, emphasizing their
significance and potential applications in network analysis.
